        <p className="primary-text-privacy-headers">5. Data Security</p>
        <p className="primary-text-privacy">
          We employ robust security measures to protect your information. These
          measures include token-based authorization to secure access to your
          account and data, and we leverage MongoDB's built-in security
          features, such as role-based access control and encryption at rest, to
          safeguard the data stored in our database. Importantly, we do not
          store your passwords or other highly sensitive information directly.
          Instead, we rely exclusively on secure, token-based authentication.
          <br />
          <br />
          While we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of data
          security, it's important to acknowledge that no method of transmission
          over the internet or electronic storage can guarantee absolute
          security. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal
          information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any
          information you transmit to us.
